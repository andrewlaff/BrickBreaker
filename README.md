# Brick-Breaker
This is a game starts with multiple levels of bricks that must be destroyed using a ball.  This bouncing ball will deflect off walls, bricks and the paddle.  The paddle is able to move side to side, using the left and right arrow keys, and keeps the ball from touching the bottom of the screen.  If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, a lift is lost.  Once all lives are lost, the game is over.  However, if you are able to destroy all bricks, you will move on to the next level until you eventually win the game.
